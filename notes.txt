I'm unhappy because enums are not scoped (in C only)
and I cannot fix it

ARRAY & FUNCTION_POINTER declarations should remain in parens
because it would make confusion with all the nested ENDs

Maybe OF_SIZE should be 2 words (not)

FUNCTION_POINTER could be without parens around args (using varargs)
but that wouldn't be compatible with FUNCTION and maybe wouldn't look nice

Maybe add DO versions of FORs

SCOPE
    maybe add START_SCOPE { and make SCOPE empty
    maybe remove SCOPE
    maybe add optional name (need SCOPE & START_SCOPE)

can we include .h file after .hpp
    if not, that maybe can be handled in VB_C_CPP_FILE
    we can !
    ?

I don't want to #define new & delete
idk y
