I'm unhappy because enums are not scoped (in C only)
and I cannot fix it

SCOPE
    maybe add optional name (need SCOPE & START_SCOPE)

can we include .h file after .hpp
    if not, that maybe can be handled in VB_C_CPP_FILE
    we can !
    ?

I don't want to #define new & delete
idk y

should I add AND OR (XOR, NOR, NAND, NXOR)

i should add support for c++ initializations... when I figure them out

maybe add RETURING, as alternative to AS in FUNCTON(*)
    no, because function returning functon
        RETURNING_FUNC ?

we don't talk about VB.C++

ELSE_IF should be 2 words
    impossible?
    same with SKIP_IF, though different reason
    
IF is currently FORK IF
    could be plain IF
    could be BRANCH, ELSEIF, ELSE
    could be TEST IF
