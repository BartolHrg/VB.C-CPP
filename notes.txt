I'm unhappy because enums are not scoped (in C only)
and I cannot fix it

SCOPE
    maybe add optional name (need SCOPE & START_SCOPE)

can we include .h file after .hpp
    if not, that maybe can be handled in VB_C_CPP_FILE
    we can !
    ?

I don't want to #define new & delete
idk y

should I add AND OR (XOR, NOR, NAND, NXOR)

i should add support for c++ initializations... when I figure them out

maybe add RETURING, as alternative to AS in FUNCTON(*)
    no, because function returning functon
        RETURNING_FUNC ?

we don't talk about VB.C++

ELSE_IF should be 2 words
    impossible?
    same with SKIP_IF, though different reason
    
IF is currently FORK IF
    could be plain IF
    could be BRANCH, ELSEIF, ELSE
    could be TEST IF

NAMESPACE starts with CONTAINING, and not START
    this is for compatibility with `USING NAMESPACE std;`

RANGE
	reverse: 
		pad = 2s + b*( (e-s-1) // b )
		i = pad - _i
	descending:
		
FOR ARRAY
	ARRAY je ), __ARR_M )
	pa treba FOR biti __FOR (((
	ali je onda problem sa ostalima END
	onda COND i RANGE isto moraju biti ))
	a što ako ću htjeti FOR ARRAY COND
		
	sintaksa:
	FOR el AS double IN CUBOID my3d OF SIZE (4, 5, 6) 
	START
		el.i, el.j, el.k, *el.item
	END
	FOR el IN arr OF SIZE (6) ??????????????????
	FOR el IN MATRIX M OF SIZE (5, 6)
	
	ND
	FOR el AS double IN NDARRAY arr OF SIZE (4, 5, 6, 7)
